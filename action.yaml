    description: |
      When the job outcome is `failure`, this output may be set. The value may be one of:

      - `no-tests` - No tests were found to run.
      - `tests-failed` - One or more tests failed.

      If the job fails for any other reason this will not be set.
      This can be used with the Actions expression syntax to conditionally run steps.
